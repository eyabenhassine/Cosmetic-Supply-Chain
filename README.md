# 🧠📦 Cosmetic Supply Chain Intelligence

An end-to-end solution that integrates **Business Intelligence (BI)**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **Data Analytics** to optimize the **cosmetic supply chain** and support data-driven decisions.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement a smart data platform for the cosmetic supply chain that:

- Builds a **Data Warehouse** to consolidate data from production, inventory, orders, and suppliers
- Uses **AI/ML models** for demand forecasting and product recommendations
- Presents insights and KPIs using **Power BI**
- Provides a **Flask web application** for real-time access and decision-making

---

## 📊 Key Objectives

- ✅ Create a centralized and scalable **Data Warehouse** (Snowflake schema)
- ✅ Develop **predictive models** (ML) for:
  - Demand forecasting
  - Product recommendations
- ✅ Enable decision-making through **interactive dashboards** and **a web interface**
